# Rocket Academy Coding Basics: Blackjack

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a card game inspired by Blackjack, built as part of Rocket Academy's Coding Fundamentals course. The game allows the player to compete against the computer by drawing cards, with the goal of reaching as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

## How to Play
1. Click the "Play" button to start the game. Both the player and the computer will receive two cards each.
2. The scores are calculated based on the values of the cards. If either player has a score of 21 (Blackjack), the game ends immediately, and the winner is declared.
3. If neither player has a Blackjack, the player can choose to either:
   - **Hit**: Draw another card to increase their score.
   - **Stand**: End their turn and let the computer play.
4. The computer will continue drawing cards until its score is 17 or more.
5. The player and computer scores are compared, and the winner is determined based on who is closer to 21 without exceeding it.
6. The player can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
3. Start playing by clicking the "Play" button.
